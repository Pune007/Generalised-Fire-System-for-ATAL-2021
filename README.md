# Arduino-Fire-SMS
A repository for the ATAL marathon 2021. The technical aspect of the current project is programmed by me while the wiring is done my friends whom I worked on the project with. The current code is very simple and flexible. Many new features can easily be added.

 Thank you for reading !
